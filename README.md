Vampire the Masquerade Charactere Sheet - Firefox extension

This is a homemade project and my first official attempt at building an extension.

This is a fan-made extension and not affiliated with or endorsed by White Wolf Publishing, Onyx Path Publishing, Renegade Game Studios or Paradox interactive. Vampire: The Masquerade and all related terms are trademarks of Paradox Interactive AB.

Instructions:
Simply add the extension as you would any other, hit the extension button on your firerox and open the character sheet app.

The character sheet is normally fillable but please note that when you select a dot for an Attribute, Ability, Advantage etc all previous dots wll be filled as well and when you select it again all dots will be cleared

This character sheet offers an Import - Export functionality so you can have access to all your characters. The produced file is in json format, the name of the file is by default your character's name and will saved in your Downloads folder unless you have changed you settings.
